# Overview
This is a template of script that automates the release note generation process. Running the script will:
 - Extract information from the changeset files in the `changelogs/fragments` directory
 - Perform basic validations to ensure proper fragment format
 - Map the changelog entries in these files to their appropriate changelog section headings
 - Generate the changelog section for the new release and add it to the top of the changelog
 - Create a release notes document to accompany the new release
 - Delete the changeset files from the `changelogs/fragments` directory

When a new product release is ready for general availability, OpenSearch maintainers can run the following script command from the command line:
```bash
 yarn release_note:generate
```

# Workflow Flowchart

The following flow chart, built using [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) syntax, illustrates the logic this workflow follows.

(NOTE: If you are viewing this README in an IDE or code editor, the flow chart will not render. To view the chart, please visit this README file on GitHub's website, which includes built-in support for Mermaid syntax.)

```mermaid
graph TD
    A(release_note_script starts) --> B(get all files from fragment directory)
    B --> C{is it a yml file?}
    C -- Yes --> D{is it properly formatted?}
    C -- No --> E(skip that file and warn) --> I{all files checked?}
    D -- Yes --> F(read and store entry from file) --> I
    D -- No --> G(throw error and terminate)
    I -- Yes --> H(generate sections using fragment files)
    I -- No --> C
    H --> J(move fragment files to temp folder)
    J --> K(update changelog file with sections)
    K --> L(generate release note with sections)
    L --> M{is changelog and release note successfully updated?}
    M -- Yes --> N(delete temp folder and fragment files)
    M -- No --> G
```

# Modifying the script
Should you wish to modify the script for your repository. It is pretty straightforward. Below are some common areas to look:
- change file paths & locations --> modify the const paths in generate_release_note_helper.ts
    ```typescript
    export const filePath = ...
    export const fragmentDirPath = ...
    export const fragmentTempDirPath = ...
    export const releaseNotesDirPath = ...
    ```
- change section names --. modify the const SECTION_MAPPING in generate_release_note_helper.ts
    ```typescript
    export const SECTION_MAPPING = ...
    ```
- change max entry length or other validation criteria --> modify const MAX_ENTRY_LENGTH or validateFragment function in generate_release_note_helper.ts
    ```typescript
    const MAX_ENTRY_LENGTH = ...
    ```
    ```typescript
    export function validateFragment(content: string) {
        ...
        const entryRegex = ...
        ...
    }
    ```
